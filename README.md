The provided instructions aim to resolve a GPU or memory-related issue encountered when running a node on a personal device. Here's a step-by-step guide to implement the fix:

---

### **Cause of the Issue**
- The error likely arises due to an **old GPU** or **low RAM** on the device.
- The solution involves adjusting environment variables and configuration files to optimize resource usage.

---

### **Steps to Fix the Issue**

#### **1. Stop the Node**
- Use `Ctrl + C` in the terminal to stop the running node.

---

#### **2. Modify `.bashrc` File**
This step adjusts an environment variable to manage GPU memory usage.

1. Open the `.bashrc` file:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```
   - If `.bashrc` does not exist, create it by running `touch ~/.bashrc` before opening it.

2. Add the following line at the end of the file:
   ```bash
   export PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO=0.0
   ```

3. Save and exit:
   - Press `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, and hit `Enter`.

4. Reload the `.bashrc` file to apply changes:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

---

#### **3. Edit the Configuration File**
Adjust GPU memory utilization in the YAML configuration file.

- For **WSL/Linux**:
  ```bash
  nano ~/rl-swarm/hivemind_exp/configs/gpu/grpo-qwen-2.5-0.5b-deepseek-r1.yaml
  ```

- For **Mac**:
  ```bash
  nano ~/rl-swarm/hivemind_exp/configs/mac/grpo-qwen-2.5-0.5b-deepseek-r1.yaml
  ```

1. Locate this line in the file:
   ```yaml
   vllm_gpu_memory_utilization: 0.2
   ```

2. Change its value to `0.4`:
   ```yaml
   vllm_gpu_memory_utilization: 0.4
   ```

3. Save and exit:
   - Press `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, and hit `Enter`.

---

#### **4. Restart Terminal and Node**
- Close your terminal or WSL session.
- Reopen it and restart your node application.

---

### **Why These Changes Work**
1. Setting `PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO=0.0` disables upper limits for GPU memory allocation, preventing out-of-memory errors but with some risk of system instability[4][8][11].
2. Increasing `vllm_gpu_memory_utilization` from `0.2` to `0.4` allows better utilization of available GPU memory while staying within safe limits[6][10].

These adjustments optimize resource usage for devices with limited hardware capabilities, resolving errors effectively!
